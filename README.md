# TEFLbot
## Chatbot with GPT4All, Google Text-to-Speech, speech_recognition, and LangChain

This code creates a chatbot that leverages a local implementation of GPT4All to do the thinking, Google Text-to-Speech and speech_recognition to do the speaking and listening, and LangChain serving as a bridge to search local documents and sklearn to calculate the document relevance before sending it all to ChatGPT4All with pygame as an orchestrator.

The chatbot works as follows:

1. It looks through the local file system and loads up documents as context for the query to ChatGPT4 before the response is generated.
2. This means localized expert robots or even bots that can interrogate strange file structures can be easily created. You can point the bot at some log files, for example, and ask it if there is anything unusual about them.

### Limitations

- You can only load so many documents before the memory runs out.
- sklearn is used to try to check the relevance of documents before loading them, but you could just point the program to the documents you want and not worry about it.

The basic implementation in `main.py` will say, "What would you like to have a conversation about?" Then it will go into a listening mode and then try to respond. Finally, it will say, "Ask a question." and go into listening mode again.

To run:
```
python3 main.py
```

While the program speaks and listens, output on the command line looks like:
```

You: what is the name of this llm model

Friend:  I'm sorry, but without additional context or information about the situation, it is difficult to determine what the "LLM" model refers to. Can you please provide more details?

Friend:  The capital city of Japan is Tokyo.

You: what are three great things about Tokyo

Friend:  As an AI assistant, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, here are some interesting facts about Tokyo:

1. Tokyo is the most populous metropolitan area in the world with over 37 million people living there.
2. Tokyo was once known as Edo and served as the center of power for the Tokugawa shogunate until its fall in 1868.
3. Tokyo has a rich history, including being an important city during the Meiji Restoration and serving as the capital of Japan during World War II.

The `main_RAG.py` implementation looks through local files for files relevant to the user query and includes them in the context for the call to the LLM.

- `speech_recognition` (sr): This library can use online services for speech recognition. Specifically, when using `recognize_google()`, it sends audio data to Google's servers for processing.
- `gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech): This library makes API calls to Google's servers to generate speech from text.

The `main_offline_only.py` implementation runs entirely offline. The impact on performance can vary, but here's a general breakdown of what you might expect:

**Speech Recognition:**
- Accuracy: Expect a 10-20% decrease in accuracy compared to cloud-based solutions like Google's speech recognition.
- Speed: Local processing might be 1.5-2x slower, depending on your hardware.

**Text-to-Speech:**
- Quality: Local TTS engines like pyttsx3 tend to sound more robotic. The difference in naturalness could be quite noticeable, perhaps a 30-40% decline in perceived quality.
- Speed: Generation speed might be similar or slightly slower than cloud-based solutions.

**Embeddings and Vector Search:**
- Quality: Local models like SentenceTransformer can be quite good. You might see only a 5-10% decrease in relevance compared to more advanced cloud models.
- Speed: Embedding generation and search could be 2-3x slower, especially on first run or with large document sets.

**Language Model (GPT4All):**
- Quality: Depending on the specific model used, you might see a 10-30% decrease in response quality compared to state-of-the-art cloud models.
- Speed: Generation speed could be 2-5x slower, heavily dependent on your hardware (especially GPU availability).

**Overall System Performance:**
- Latency: Expect the overall response time to increase by 50-100% due to all processing happening locally.
- Resource Usage: The application will use significantly more local CPU, RAM, and potentially GPU resources.

Change the `speak` function to change languages and voices.
```python
def speak(text, lang='en', tld='co.uk'):
```
